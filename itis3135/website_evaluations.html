                <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a>
            </h3>
            <p>This is Yale University's art school website with links and information pertaining to the school.</p>
            <h3>
                <a href="https://unseen.co/">Unseen Studio</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Unseen Studio is a website design agency.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>C ontrast</li>
                <p>Unseen's makes the wording contrast with the background so it is never hard to read. Yale has the background of text highlighted which is easy to read, but ugly to look at. </p>
                <li>R epetition</li>
                <p>Yale uses the same gradient background for each section which is consistent throughout. Unseen doesn't use the same thing over and over, rather uses the same layout for each section you're in.</p>
                <li>A lignment</li>
                <p>Yale's alignment is all left which leaves too much open space on the right. Unseen centers their work making the page even.</p>
                <li>P roximity</li>
                <p>Unseen groups the different designs by color meaning all the blues, greens, etc are grouped together for ease of use. Yale has everything in sections, but they aren't labeled well and contain lots of hard to read text.</p>
