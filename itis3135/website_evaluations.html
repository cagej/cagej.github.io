                <a href="https://www.art.yale.edu/">Yale School of Art</a>
            </h3>
            <p>This is Yale University's art school website with links and information pertaining to the school. This is an example of a bad website.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>C</b>ontrast: Yale has the background of text highlighted which is easy to read, but lacks clarity as the colors change throughout.</li>
                <li><b>R</b>epetition: Yale uses the same gradient background for each section which is consistent throughout. </li>
                <li><b>A</b>lignment: Yale's alignment is all left which leaves too much open space on the right. </li>
                <li><b>P</b>roximity: Yale has everything in sections, but they aren't labeled well and contain lots of hard to read text.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3 class="good-website">
                <a href="https://unseen.co/">Unseen Studio</a>
            </h3>
            <p>Unseen Studio is a website design agency. This is an example of a good website.</p>
            <ul>
                <li><b>C</b>ontrast: Unseen makes the wording contrast with the background so it is never hard to read.</li>
                <li><b>R</b>epetition: Unseen doesn't use the same thing over and over, rather the same layout for each section letting the website flow.</li>
                <li><b>A</b>lignment: Unseen centers their work and has everything the same size.</li>
                <li><b>P</b>roximity: Unseen groups the different designs by color meaning all the blues, greens, etc are grouped together for ease of use.</li>
            </ul>
