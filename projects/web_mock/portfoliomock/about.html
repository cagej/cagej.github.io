                    <h1>My name is Cage Jennings...</h1>
                    <br>
                    <p>and I'm a junior at UNC Charlotte majoring in Computer Science with a minor in Statistics. 
                        My focus within the degree is data science and I am currently<br> data for my first project. 
                        I currently work for Apple at the data center in Maiden and that allows me to see the IT side of the tech world as opposed to only<br> ever programming.
                        Outside of school I watch and follow a lot of different sports with the main ones being soccer, basketball, and racing. 
                        I spend most of<br> my free time hiking, sim racing, or cooking because unfortunately I cannot bake.
                    </p>
                    <br>
                    <br>
